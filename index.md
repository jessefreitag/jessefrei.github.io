Hi! I'm Jesse. I am a currently completing my Masters in Financial Mathematics at the University of Chicago. Some of my coursework includes Monte Carlo Simulation, Stochastic Processes, Time Series Analysis, Numerical Methods, and Option Theory.

In the past I have interned as a Quantitative Risk and Research Intern at DV Trading LLC as well as completing projects and partnering with BlackRock, The Options Clearing Corporation, and Neuberger Berman.

I graduated in December 2022 from Stony Brook University with a BS in Applied Mathematics and Statistics and BA in Economics.

For fun, you can catch me playing competitive Geoguessr or playing piano and bagpipes.
