Hi! I'm Jesse. I am a current graduate student in Financial Mathematics at the University of Chicago, where I am preparing for a career in quantitative finance. Some of my coursework includes Probability & Stochastic Processes, Portolio Management and Risk Management, Option Theory, and Python.

From graduating from Stony Brook University with an Applied Mathematics & Statistics, B.S. and Economics, B.A. to now being in graduate school, my coursework is multidisciplinary; combining mathematics, statistics, computer science, and financial theory to help me analyze and solve complex problems.

I spent approximately two years working at GM Advisory Group, a New York Wealth Management firm as a Research Analyst focusing on macroeconomic research and developing quantitative economic models. My team and I developed linear and logistic regression models, as well as experimented with ARIMA and GARCH models to predict macroeconomic indicators including CPI Index, Recessionary Earnings Contraction, and Industrial Production. Additionally, I was tasked with automating redundant processes to alleviate hours of manual work for my using VBA and Python. These experiencez provided motivation to pursuing graduate studies in Financial Mathematics.

Here is my resume.
