Hi! I'm Jesse. I am a current graduate student in Financial Mathematics at the University of Chicago, where I am preparing for a career in quantitative finance. Some of my coursework includes Probability & Stochastic Processes, Portolio Management and Risk Management, Option Theory, and Python.

From graduating from Stony Brook University with an Applied Mathematics & Statistics, BS and Economics, BA with highest Latin honors, to now being in graduate school, my coursework is multidisciplinary; combining mathematics, statistics, computer science, and financial theory to help me analyze and solve complex problems.

I spent approximately two years working at GM Advisory Group, a New York-based Wealth Management firm as a Research Analyst focusing on macroeconomic research and developing quantitative economic models. My team and I developed linear and logistic regression models, as well as experimented with ARIMA and GARCH models to predict macroeconomic indicators including CPI Index, Recessionary Earnings Contraction, and Industrial Production. Additionally, I was tasked with automating redundant processes to alleviate hours of manual work for my colleagues using VBA and Python. These experiences provided motivation to pursuing graduate studies in Financial Mathematics.
