Hi! I'm Jesse. I am a current graduate student in Financial Mathematics at the University of Chicago, where I am preparing for a career in quantitative finance. Some of my coursework includes Monte Carlo Simulation, Stochastic Processes, Time Series Analysis, Multivariate Statistical Analysis and Option Theory.

From graduating from Stony Brook University with an Applied Mathematics & Statistics, BS and Economics, BA with highest Latin honors, to now being in graduate school, my coursework is multidisciplinary; combining mathematics, statistics, computer science, and financial theory to help me analyze and solve complex problems.
